Integrate doxygen with cmake
such that when there is code change, there is a change in the documentation as well

Separately, doxygen does not have to be invoked for this purpose

Connecting doxygen to the makefile ensures that, on running cmake and then make 
The documentation is created side by side, separately, the command doxygen does not have to be run to create the html, latex folders for the documentation

This can be automated using github actions, where on push of code this entire thing 
is run and the operations are performed

This command
 cmake -S . -B ../build-folder/ creates the makefiles and other cmake artifacts in the build-folder directory

On running make in the build-folder, the executable as well as documentation is generated

On code change or docs change,
CMake is run to generate the make build files, and written to the build-folder
When make is run in the build-folder, it generated the docs
The documentation is built automatically at build-folder/html/index.html


The way this works :

include : consists of the headers
src : main cpp files
docs_sphinx : the template created using sphinx-quickstart, and a Doxyfile
